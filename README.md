Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
**The DriverPass project was a system I had to design to allow students to take online driving practice exams, and allow students to schedule
driving practice with their drivers. Many students fail their initial driving exams, this program will help alleviate that issue. My client is DriverPass. What I did particularly well was designing the different UML diagrams. I showed how the system would let their customers take exams or purchase driving packages.**

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
**If I could revise one part of my work it would be my business requirements documents. More specifically, the nonfunctional requirements section. When documenting what needs to be done in a project it is important to be as specific and detailed as possible. There are many parts of this section where I could've added more detail, such as, platform constraints and accuaracy and precision.**

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
**Initially we had an interview with the client DriverPass to find what they wanted in their system. Using this interview I extracted everything they wanted and implemented it in my design. It is always important to consider the user's needs when designing. Typically the user knows what their customer needs. Our job as developers is to ask many questions to ensure we understand what is needed of us.**

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
**There are many different approaches to take when designing software. For myself, I will gather as much information as I need and document it. After, I will develop multiple UML diagrams. This will help me visualize what my program should do, it also allows me to brief my clients or coworkers on what needs to be done. Finally, I will begin developing my program following my UML and documentation.**
